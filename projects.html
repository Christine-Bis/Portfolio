            <p>
                Myself and my team have worked decided to join the Microsoft hackathon in 2021.
                We were challange to create an idea that would help with GBV in South Africa,
                as of 2021 the GBV cases were over 13 000 and there were over 10 000 rape cases.
                We created "S.H.E", which Stands for Safe Home for Everyone to help tacke this issue in South Africa.

        <li>MTN TadHack</li>
            <p>
                The theme for the 2021 TADHack South Africa was: 
                “emerging from the pandemic – collaboration and monetisation towards the 4IR”. 
                The aim was to challenge participants to see how South Africa can emerge from the pandemic by solving local 
                COVID-19 related issues by using the ayoba messaging app and a multitude of local and global sponsor technologies.
                We created "Stoka" for this hackathon, which is Marketplace app which gives small business owners a platform to sell their propducts on the MTN Ayoba App.

        <li>BIDataHack</li>
        <P>
            In 2020 I joined my second hackaton which was the BIDataHack.
            From this hackathon we came up with Agricode.
            Agricode is an application meant to help subsistence farmers by providing environmental
            data to improve crop yields.
            It runs on any phone that can access the Internet and offers freemium and subscription models. 
            Premium subscribers enter their location and will be given real-time data of all their farms, 
            including soil moisture, expected rainfall, cattle grazing patterns and the best crops to grow
            on each farm.
            AgriCode uses IoT sensors to gather humidity and temperature samples as well as third-party
            weather APIs to make predictions.

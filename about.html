    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I am a 24-year-old student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Education with a major in accounting.<br>
        Despite my academic focus, my interests extend beyond education to a diverse range of hobbies such as coding, gaming, sewing, playing softball, and video editing. 
        My passion for coding has been a consistent thread in my life, beginning around four years ago when I started participating in hackathons.<br>
        I was privilaged enough to participate in the microsoft hackathon, MTN hackathon, Nemisa and many more where my team and I won a few of those.
        I really enjoy web development and have learnt HTML, CSS, and JAVA SCRIPT at a beginer level. 
        I stoppped participating in hackathons in 2022, which led to me not coding for about 2 years.<br>
        However I decided to challange myself and apply for the Power learn Project scolarship in 2024, 
        which has now motivated me to continue persuing something im extreemly passionate about.
        I look forward to building more projects and growing my skills, join me on my journey.
